# week-1-code-challenge
In Week 1 code challenge project, I will be tackling some basic coding challenge. I will divide this project into three challenges; The first one will be Student Grade Calculator, followed by Speed Detector and then Net Salary Calculator.

# Student Grade Calculator
This javascript program calculates the students' grades based on the marks attained.
Every grade is assigned a mark range, against which a student's marks can be scored to determine their grade.
For instance, marks above 79 to 100 qualify as grade A, therefore, a student who scores 86 marks for instance will be graded as an A.

# Speed Detector
The program calculates the demerit point to be given to driver for every 5 km/s they drive above speed limit.
It also detects whether the diver is overspeeding or driving within the speed limit. It can suspend the driver's licence if they max out.

# Net Salary Calculator
This third program is task primarily with calculating an individual's net salary by factoring in their deductibles.
The net salary is arrived at by calculating their PAYE Tax, NHIF and NSSF deductions, and then deducting them from the gross salary.
